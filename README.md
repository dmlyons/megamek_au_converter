# megamek_au_converter

This tool converts the old planetary system xml into the new yaml format. This is highly experimental and comes with no guarantees. Make backups.

Easiest way to use this is to run it in the same directory as **A COPY** of your customized systems.xml and systems_events.xml files, then take the resulting yaml in the out directory and put it where you need it.

```
Usage of megamek_au_converter:
